  description: "Hey there, I'm VENKATRAMAN NAGARAJAN! a developer who thrives on curiosity and clarity. I love transforming messy problems into elegant code and believe the best way to learn is to jump in and explore. To me, software isn’t just code—it’s craft.",
  description2: "I'm a developer who treats debugging like detective work and loves refactoring code at 2 AM just because the indentation bugs me. I’m passionate about writing code so clean it could put my sock drawer to shame. I believe good documentation is like flossing: everyone knows they should do it, but few actually do. If you’re looking for someone who writes solid code and sprinkles in dad jokes for good measure, let’s chat!",
